        <p>Are you tired of looking around stores only to find party games meant for 4 or more people? <em>Look no more.</em>
        Our games are hand-picked for two or more players, because we at It Takes Two know what it's like when you want a quiet game night in with a loved one.</p>
 
        <p>We specialize in games that are both:
          <ul>
            <li>Made specifically for two players</li>
            <li>Games that can be played with more than two people, but are suitable for two as well</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
